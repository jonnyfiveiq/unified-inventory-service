URL configuration for the apps package.

This file is for custom URL patterns that need to load BEFORE individual app
URLs. Use this for:

- Service-level customizations (top-level urls.py is framework-managed)
- Priority/override patterns that must match before app-defined routes
- Cross-app endpoints combining functionality from multiple apps

This file loads at step 3 in the URL loading order, before individual apps
(step 4). For full documentation, see: inventory_service/urls.py

## Example

    from django.urls import path
    from apps.core.views import SomeView

    urlpatterns = [
        path("api/v1/priority-endpoint/", SomeView.as_view(), name="priority"),
    ]

"""

urlpatterns = [
    # Define your service-specific, priority, or cross-app URL patterns here
]
